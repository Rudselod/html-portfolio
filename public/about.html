<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started out wanting to Learn Programming, because I was feeling bored in my work environment at the time. I'm an electricion by trade, and was working away from my family a lot, and that started me down the path of programming, as a solution to being able to work from home, and see my family more.</p>

<p>One of the first thing that I learned while I was studding how to start, was getting an purpose of why you want to learn programming, so then I looked at my work environment and found an website idea. Personally I think it might be something special once I can build it, but that is still a long way from getting done.</p>

<p>I have been studding programming for an while now and can't wait to build simple websites for my family and close friends. If someone sees my skills thus far and want to use if for a project part time, feel free to contact me.
